# cellular-automata.hy
Just a bunch of cellular automata I wrote in Hy and Pyxel to learn Hy

## What I got so far
- [Elementary Cellular Automaton](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html) - supports all 256 rules, provide a rule as a command line argument, selects a random rule if none is provided
- [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) - an Ant-based computer\*
